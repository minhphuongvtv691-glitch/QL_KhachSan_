# CHANGELOG — Hotel PMS Documentation

## Rules
- Every change to `/docs/` MUST be logged here before commit.
- Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] — @author — file(s) — reason — what changed`
- If a constraint rule is added/modified → note which edge case or incident triggered it.
- If an API endpoint is added/removed → reference the phase (P1/P2/P3).
- Retention: permanent (do not delete old entries).
